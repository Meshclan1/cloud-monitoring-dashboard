## 2️⃣ Check EC2 Metrics in CloudWatch (No setup needed)

**Time needed: 5 minutes**

### 💡 What You’re Doing

Verifying your EC2 instance’s default performance metrics (CPU, network, disk) are visible in CloudWatch.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Navigate to CloudWatch → Metrics
2. Go to EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics
3. Find your EC2 instance ID and confirm metrics like:
   `CPUUtilization`
   `NetworkIn` / `NetworkOut`
   `DiskReadBytes` / `DiskWriteBytes`

### ✅ How You Know It Worked

- Metrics graphs show data points after a few minutes
- No extra setup is required to collect these basic metrics

## 3️⃣ Create CloudWatch Alarms

**Time needed: 10 minutes each alarm**

### 💡 What You’re Doing

Setting up automatic alerts when certain metrics exceed safe thresholds.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Go to **CloudWatch → Alarms → Create alarm**
2. Choose a metric (e.g., `CPUUtilization`)
3. Set a threshold (e.g., CPU > 80% for 5 minutes)
4. Choose notification via **SNS topic**
5. Name and create the alarm

### ✅ How You Know It Worked

- Alarm status shows as **OK**
- You receive a notification when you intentionally stress the server

## 4️⃣ Set Up SNS Notifications

**Time needed: 5 minutes**

### 💡 What You’re Doing

Creating a channel for CloudWatch to send alerts.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Go to **SNS → Topics → Create topic**
2. Type: **Standard**
3. Name: `monitoring-alerts`
4. Create the topic
5. Add a subscription:
   - Protocol: **Email**
   - Endpoint: Your email address
6. Confirm the subscription via the email AWS sends you

### ✅ How You Know It Worked

- Subscription shows as **Confirmed** in SNS console
- You receive an email when an alarm triggers

## 5️⃣ Configure SES for Email Alerts

**Time needed: 5 minutes**

### 💡 What you're doing

Setting up AWS to send you alert emails.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Go to AWS Console → Search "SES" → Click Simple Email Service
2. Click the left side hamburger menu. Then under configuration banner, select "identities"
3. Click "Create identity"
4. Choose "Email address"
5. Enter your email address → Click "Create identity"
6. **Go check your email** → Click the verification link
7. Come back to AWS → Your email should show "Verified"

### ✅ How to know it worked

Your email shows green checkmark and says "Verified"

---

## 6️⃣ Create a CloudWatch Dashboard

**Time needed: 15 minutes**

### 💡 What you're doing

Creating a page where you can see all your server metrics.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Go to **CloudWatch → Dashboards → Create dashboard**
2. Name: `business-ops-dashboard`
3. Add widgets/line charts for:
   - CPU utilization
   - Network traffic
   - Disk activity
4. Save dashboard

### ✅ How You Know It Worked

- Dashboard shows live graphs for all selected metrics. If charts are empty, wait 5-10 minutes for data to populate.

# Section 3: Troubleshooting ⚙️

- **No metrics?** Check EC2 IAM role permissions for CloudWatch
- **No alerts?** Verify SNS subscription and SES email settings
- **Slow data updates?** CloudWatch metrics may take 5 minutes to refresh
