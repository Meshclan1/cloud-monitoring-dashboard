# 📝 Cloud Monitoring Dashboard - Small Businesses

**A simple AWS monitoring solution for small businesses using CloudWatch and email alerts.**

## 🎯 Business Problem

```
Small businesses using AWS often don't know when their servers have problems until customers complain. They also get surprised by unexpected AWS bills at the end of the month. This can cost them customers and money.
```

## 💡 Solution Overview

I am building a monitoring dashboard using AWS CloudWatch that:

- Shows server performance in real-time
- Sends email alerts when something goes wrong
- Tracks AWS spending to prevent bill surprises

Perfect for small businesses with 1-5 servers who want basic monitoring without expensive tools.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Server Monitoring** - Track CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Email Alerts** - Get notified when servers have problems
- **Cost Tracking** - Monitor AWS spending with budget alerts
- **Simple Dashboard** - Easy-to-read charts and graphs
- **Mobile Friendly** - Check status from your phone

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Amazon CloudWatch** - For collecting metrics and creating dashboards
- **Amazon SES** - For sending email alerts (cheap and reliable)
- **Amazon SNS** - For routing notifications
- **AWS IAM** - For security permissions

**Why these services?** They work well together and most are included in AWS free tier.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**How it works:**

1. CloudWatch collects data from your servers
2. When something goes wrong, it triggers an alarm
3. The alarm sends a message through SNS
4. You get an email alert via SES
5. You can view everything on the CloudWatch dashboard

## 🔧 Challenges Overcome

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

**AWS Skills I Developed:**

- Setting up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- Configuring SES for email delivery
- Basic IAM permissions for security
- Understanding AWS free tier limits

**General Lessons:**

- Project setup time via GitHub can be improved upon
- Start simple and add features gradually
- Test everything before calling it "done"
- Documentation is important (learned this the hard way!)
- Cost monitoring should be built in from the start

## 🚀 Future Improvements

**Next steps:**

- Add more types of alerts (disk space, network issues)
- Create better-looking dashboards
- Set up automatic responses to common problems
- Learn Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)

**Would be cool to add:**

- Slack notifications instead of just email
- Automatic server restart for some problems
- Integration with business metrics (sales, orders)

**Learning goals:**

- Get better at Infrastructure as Code
- Learn more about AWS security
- Understand how to scale this for bigger businesses
